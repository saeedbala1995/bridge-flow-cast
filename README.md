# Bridge Flow Cast

LSTM-based predictor for forecasting **water surface profiles over bridges during extreme floods**, developed as part of the study published in *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence* (Elsevier, 2024).

## ðŸ“¦ Quick start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bridge-flow-cast.git
   cd bridge-flow-cast
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run a prediction** (using provided sample input)
   ```bash
   python bridge_flow_cast.py        --model ./model/LSTM_new.keras        --scaler ./model/scaler.joblib        --input sample/sample_input.csv        --out sample/predictions.csv
   ```

4. **Results**
   - Predicted water surface profiles are saved in `predictions.csv`.  
   - A visualization is automatically generated as `predictions.png`.

## ðŸ“˜ Model Output Interpretation  

The predictor estimates the **water surface profile** across the bridge under flood scenarios.  

- **X-axis (longitudinal coordinate):**  
  Distance along the bridge (m). In this model, predictions are made at 61 discrete points between upstream and downstream.

- **Y-axis (normalized vertical coordinate):**  
  Vertical position of the water surface, expressed as:

  \[
  \frac{y}{h + D}
  \]

  where:  
  - \( y \) = water level (vertical coordinate),  
  - \( h \) = pier height,  
  - \( D \) = deck thickness.  

  Using \( y/(h+D) \) ensures that results are **dimensionless**, making them comparable across different bridge geometries and scales.

- **Output file (`predictions.csv`):**  
  Contains normalized water surface elevations at 61 points (`wl_0` â€¦ `wl_60`).  

- **Output plot (`predictions.png`):**  
  Shows the predicted water surface profile with:  
  - X-axis: distance along the bridge (m),  
  - Y-axis: normalized water surface elevation \( y/(h+D) \).

## ðŸ“‘ Notes

- Input CSV must contain at least the following columns:
  - `depth`
  - `velocity`
  - `froude`

- Predictions are based on the optimized LSTM model described in the published paper.  
- Both the trained **model (`.keras`)** and **scaler (`.joblib`)** are provided, making the predictor **ready-to-run**.
